## Biggest Recent Financial Crisis

1920s - Great Depression

# 1920s stock bubble 

The Roaring Twenties was a period of great economic growth and widespread prosperity, with the North American and European continents as the epicenter. This period, which lasted from 1920 to 1929, was marked by a boom in culture, technology, and the economy, especially in the major cities of New York, Montreal, Chicago, Detroit, Paris, Berlin, and London. In particular, the stock market played a crucial role in the period's economic boom, which was characterized by widespread speculation and an eventual stock market bubble. 

In the United States, the stock market began to gain considerable momentum during this time, attracting everyday individuals to investing. This was a departure from the norm, as investing in the stock market was previously seen as an activity primarily for the wealthy or professional investors. The post-war optimism, technological advancements, and burgeoning consumer culture fueled this trend, and soon, investing in the stock market became a national pastime. 

The Roaring Twenties saw new forms of consumer credit, easy access to loans, and an overall reduction in the regulation of financial institutions. This easy availability of credit made it easier for people to invest in stocks, often on margin, which essentially means borrowing money to purchase securities. This situation was precarious, as an investor using margin could end up owing more than they initially invested if the stocks they purchased declined in value.

The stock market began to rise steadily, creating a bubble. Stock prices rose far above their actual value, driven by speculation and exuberance, rather than underlying business fundamentals. The idea that the stock market would keep on rising seemed almost a certainty. This irrational exuberance fed the bubble, as people were willing to pay increasingly high prices for stocks.

However, by 1929, the bubble had grown unsustainable. Stocks were massively overpriced and the market was ripe for a correction. That correction came in late October 1929, in what is now known as the Wall Street Crash. This catastrophic crash signaled the beginning of the Great Depression, a period of severe worldwide economic depression that lasted until the late 1930s.

The Roaring Twenties and the stock market bubble provide a historical lesson about the dangers of speculative bubbles, over-reliance on credit, and unregulated financial practices. While the period was marked by remarkable technological progress and cultural dynamism, the stock market bubble and its aftermath underscore the importance of financial regulation, prudent investment practices, and an understanding of economic fundamentals.
