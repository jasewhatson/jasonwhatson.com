I first started developing in Golang back in 2012 [upon version 1 release](https://go.dev/blog/go1) & since its initial release, Golang has become quite popular with several major crypto & blockchain projects. This is a quick overview of the projects which have sparked my interest firstly starting with a quote providing some insight into why Golang has had success in the blockchain space.

>Golang is a systems programming language for building networked, distributed services. The main selling point is strong [CSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes) style concurrency support.<br>
>Blockchain apps are networked, distributed services. They benefit greatly from good concurrency support, as getting this wrong can lead to loss of money.
