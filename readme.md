Nixon going of gold standard (attack from speculators speech) - to Fiat currency

The information provided in point #2 comes directly from the content of "Modern Money Mechanics". The book provides an explanation of how money is created in a fractional reserve banking system. Here is a direct quote from the book that supports this:

"Of course, they (banks) do not really pay out loans from the money they receive as deposits. If they did this, no additional money would be created. What they do when they make loans is to accept promissory notes in exchange for credits to the borrowers' transaction accounts. Loans (assets) and deposits (liabilities) both rise by the same amount."

This quote illustrates the process by which banks create money when they issue loans. Instead of using the money they have on deposit to fund the loan, banks create a new deposit in the borrower's account equal to the amount of the loan. This process increases the total amount of money in the economy because the money that the bank has on deposit (the bank's reserves) stays the same, while the amount of money in borrowers' accounts (the bank's liabilities) increases. Thus, the act of loaning money in a fractional reserve banking system effectively creates new money.

Money can be created, however, when financial intermediaries make loans. Accordingly, the concepts of money and credit are closely linked in a modern economy, albeit not one for one. When a bank extends a loan, it makes money available to the borrower, for example, to buy a car, a house or equipment for a business. The bank may credit the deposit account of the borrower, who withdraws the funds to make their purchase. Alternatively, the bank may directly credit the deposit account of the seller on behalf of the borrower. In either case, the loaned funds will tend to find their way into a deposit somewhere in the banking system. This process adds to the supply of money.
